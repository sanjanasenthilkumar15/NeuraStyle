## Project info

🌟 Overview

NEURAStyle is an Agentic AI retail system that provides a unified, human-like shopping journey across web, app, chat, kiosks, and in-store experiences.
It eliminates fragmented omnichannel transitions and boosts conversions using a multi-agent architecture.

🚀 Problem Statement

Shoppers face a broken omnichannel journey—context loss across channels, poor personalization, and inventory inconsistencies.
Retailers lose conversions, AOV, and loyalty.

🎯 Our Solution

An AI-driven conversational sales agent supported by worker agents that:
Understand user emotion, intent, style, and context
Provide AR Try-On and smart wardrobe suggestions
Maintain session continuity across all channels
Auto-manage recommendations, inventory, payments, loyalty, and checkout
Ensure privacy with UEBA, XAI, federated learning & encryption
